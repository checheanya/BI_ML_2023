## Unsupervised learning homework
In this repo you can find my homework on clustering models and tSNE. Here we played a bit with K-means, DBSCAN and hierarchical clustering.

* you can find used data in *csv* file as well as results for the last task, that contains cytometry data with labels for T-, B-cells, monocytes and nk-cells
* *Cluster_tSNE.ipynb* contains the main script
* some bonus pictures :)
